# Do-The-Wave
A 2D OpenGL Visualization made using VS 2017

Recently, I picked up the OpenGL red book, so I've been wanting to really get better practice with it than before.  This project as a whole was just an experimentation seeing how far I can go with just 2 triangles, a simple pass-through vertex shader, and a custom fragment shader.  Unfortunately, the Visual Studio files I had uploaded didn't have the correct configuration to auto load the dependencies, so I removed them all to reduce clutter.  Now all that's in this repository is my own code. Dependencies for this project are  GLEW and GLFW.

It should now be dynamically resizable as well, which means that you can resize the window to whatever you want and it'll fix itself :).
