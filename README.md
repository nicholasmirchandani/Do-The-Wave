# Do-The-Wave
A 2D OpenGL Visualization made using VS 2017

Recently, I picked up the OpenGL red book, so I've been wanting to really get better practice with it than before.  This project as a whole was just an experimentation seeing how far I can go with just 2 triangles, a simple pass-through vertex shader, and a custom fragment shader.  Everything uploaded is a Visual Studio 2017 solution, so hopefully there shouldn't be any problems, but all that should be needed are the additional includes and libraries from GLEW and GLFW.  Code's written to hopefully be cross platform, although as of now it is stuck at 1920 x 1080 as a resolution.

It should now be dynamically resizable as well, which means that you can resize the window to whatever you want and it'll fix itself :).
